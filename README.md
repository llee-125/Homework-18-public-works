# UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp Lessons Learned...Now What?

    As an unemployed, 53 years old wife and mother with 1 kid launched and the other in their last year, I decided to apply for the UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp (“Bootcamp”)….call it a mid-life crisis or boredom, I was enthusiastic! With a strong background in office work and computers, I considered myself intermediate to advanced in computing and applications knowledge. The course was scheduled in-person and was part-time, 3 days a week, it was strongly recommended at least 20 hours of study each week. Sounded doable, I got this….then, COVID hit. We didn’t even get 1 class in person. I am proud of myself that I kept on going and never quit, even after 3 different attempts to quit. Special thanks to my instructors and TAs for keeping me going, I learned so much about programming, people and myself!

## Here is my story!

### **No Prerequisites, but be prepared AND do the pre-work**

The pre-work is very important and gives students a head start on what is involved in the course. I had no clue and did not get the pre-work complete, BIG MISTAKE! I recommend enrolling at least 1 week before class starts, do the pre-work and be ready. As far as hardware goes, it was helpful to use multiple monitors, especially with the remote learning. I used 2 monitors, plus my laptop and it made it easy to follow the video, code and have a web page available for searches.

### **Instructors, TAs and Tutors….oh my**

My instructor and the TAs were informative and enthusiastic; it was easy to see how much they enjoyed teaching and programming and they kept our class engaged. The use of breakout groups was a heavy part of this course and students were expected to work together and learn from one another. During the first session, I remember my instructor emphasizing inquisitivity, participation and sharing. I believe he said: “ get over being shy and not asking questions because that won’t help you to learn programming. Most programming in large companies is done in groups, with teams using agile methodology. ” This was even more important since we were all online. The asking questions part was difficult for me, the perfectionist, but I learned quickly to ask questions or be left behind. Other support included a Slack “AskBCS” and individual tutors (1 day a week). I had the same tutor for most of the course and she was a gem.

Weekly instruction is 13 hours a week including office hours; studying is recommended at 20 hours per week, plus homework, which can take up to 10 hours a week. The course is intense, after all no prerequisites and you come out with knowledge as a full-stack MERN developer in 6 months, what do you expect? Office hours are a unique time to chat with instructors and other students, bring up questions or broken code, geek out and learn programmer-speak. Highly recommend attending office hours as it becomes a place to reinforce prior learnings and so much more. I will miss this part of class the most!

This Bootcamp course teaches a wide range of programming tools at each session: such as, program languages (HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, React, etc.); desktop and software applications (Node, GitHub, Postman, Bootstrap, VS Code, Jest, Express, Sequelize,); GUI components (APIs, etc.); database systems (mySQL, MongoDB, etc.) and more. Homeworks are due each week, which correspond to what was learned the prior week. Sounds normal, just like a regular class; however, for me the content was difficult to learn during each lecture. I understood the concepts and would have to rewatch the videos at my speed to reinforce the learnings and move forward to complete homeworks. Many of my classmates were young people who have likely spent their entire life on computers, so maybe they had advantages or maybe they completed the pre-work and were better prepared.

### **Projects**

In addition to homework there are 3 group projects during this course. Remote, given obvious challenges, worked well and most students seemed to have a genuine wish to work together and teach one another. I enjoyed receiving individual messages from students explaining code or giving tips--I am not sure that would happen in person. Looking back, I think I learned the most working on projects as it was more like real life being on a team and producing something together. Although I was most nervous going into the projects, I came out of each project with a better understanding of the concept/s and with more confidence. I remember having terrible conflicts in GitHub and us working late at night and everyone getting frustrated, especially me….. the instructor helped me chill and remember that programming requires persistence, perseverance, and flexibility. A good lesson even for a 53 year old perfectionist!

### **Now What?**

I didn’t make the time to take advantage of the many Bootcamp career services program offerings during the course, there were videos and professional material preparation tips, many benefits. However, following graduation, I look forward to utilizing those services in an effort to find the right fit.

### **_A Highlight of My learnings include:_**

- A _MERN stack app_ (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) is a fully operating web development framework for the web where the above components work together to take information in and return information with both a front end and a back end.

- _API_ (Application Programming Interface) is software that allows routes to communicate and send and receive information on the front end and the back end of an application.

- Be a _GoogleFu_. (An expert google searcher, learn to find anything!)

- The anatomy of an app, as explained by my instructor: **JavaScript = brains, HTML = bones, CSS = skin**
  ….however, _JavaScript_ is really lit (aka, cool) with what it can do to make an app exceptional. I am still learning JS and will likely be continuing to learn every day.

* _GitHub_ is great, once you learn NOT to create conflicts.

* Once you master _Postman_, you are set. There are more advanced features, but testing routes as a beginning programmer is huge and Postman is the path to get you there.

* _VS Code (Visual Studio Code)_ is my friend and is a free editor that works with Node.js to write and check code.

* I like working with databases, that might be my calling.

So, learn, never stop learning. If programming sounds interesting, go for it. There are many programs and online services to teach all aspects of programming. Don’t be intimidated by the younger generation, you might find your calling!
